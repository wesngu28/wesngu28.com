# My Website

My personal portfolio/website, a project made in Astro with Tailwind and SolidJS integrations.

This is a migration of a Next.js website [here](https://github.com/wesngu28/wesngu28.com).

#### Stack
1. Astro - a static site builder and ssr framework implementing the islands architecture for fast load
2. Tailwind - a CSS utility class library to make working with css feel more elegant and smooth
3. SolidJS - a javascript framework similar to react that sheds the virtual dom dependency
4. MapboxJS

#### Contents
/ - Index page, normal stuff you'd expect detailing skills and projects

/ - About page, extra fluff and Javascript practice for me

/ - Map page, custom implementation of a scrollytelling map with intersection observer, can be heavy on load

/ - Blog - just some stuff I want to write about
