# My Website

My personal portfolio/website, a project made in Astro with Tailwind and SolidJS integrations.

### Stack
1. [Astro](https://astro.build/) - a static site builder and ssr framework implementing the islands architecture for fast load
2. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a CSS utility class library to make working with css feel more elegant and smooth
3. [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) - a javascript framework similar to react that sheds the virtual dom dependency

### Contents
/ - Index page, normal stuff you'd expect detailing skills and projects

/ - About page, extra fluff and Javascript practice for me

/ - Map page, custom implementation of a scrollytelling map with intersection observer, can be heavy on load

/ - Blog - just some stuff I want to write about

/ - Projects - additional projects not featured
