This is a webapp that implements the Spotify oauth flow to allow you to login through your Spotify account. You can then input Spotify tracks, albums, artists, and playlists to view brief statistics, get Youtube links, and recommendations, as well as get your top played artists and songs when logged in.

## Why

The backend was initially a script that I converted to a flask app (where flask served templates). At the time I was unfamiliar with most web dev technologies, but when I was enlightened I decided to undertake the task of converting this flask app to a full-stack app, keeping the Python backend but creating a separate front-end.

I spent a long time not doing anything on that front and it coincidentally linedup with me also procrastinating on teaching myself React and its fundamentals. After a lot of work and adding Next.js into the stack, I finally got to a point where I am happy with what I've done regarding what started as just a simple script.

## What I Learned

This was one of my most important projects as a self-taught frontend developer, as I basically taught myself React as well as Next.js through this project. The backend aspect was also the first time I ever worked with Flask.

## Stack

| Frontend    | Backend     | Libraries
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| React      | Python      | Chart.js |
| Next.js   |    Flask     | Spotipy |
| Typescript   |    Node.js     | Pandas |
