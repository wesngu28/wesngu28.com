Third-party viewer and live tracker for the Hololive and Holostars English members. When one of them are live, their icon will light up and you can click on it to get the current stream in the iframe.

## Why

I wanted to make a thing similar to Holodex, so I made this spotaneously to learn some of the Next 13 update but also to slightly modernize one of my older projects. A mixture of one of my creative projects for CSE154 and a project I made independently after the class ended. CSE154 is the web development class at UW, and teaches you html/css and javascript up to async/await.

The creative project specifically asked us to create our own API with express and make use of it through Javascript. At the time, I was unaware JSON could support arrays and only knew basic Vanilla Javascript. The other project was a more multi-purpose app that allowed you to add channels and track their live status through the YouTube API with additional support for those supported by the Holodex API, but I never polished or was proud of it because it used local storage and was extremely buggy. For this, I extracted portions of the Holodex portion, but I plan to turn that app into a real app with user authentication and a database eventually.

## What I Learned

Some things I learned about Next 13:

1. It seems like you really need to consider whether or not you want to use a server or client component as they now have clearly defined roles. This particular app doesn't use much components in general but I already had to split some functionality in order to use client component specific functions within a parent server component.

2. Having to use a pages folder for api seems like an awkward change, maybe it will be changed later.
