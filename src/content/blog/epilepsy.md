I had a first visit with my neurologist recently, and it looks like the seizure that sent me to the ER and made me a needle pincushion for 2 days was a result of focal epilepsy, particularly, epilepsy caused by focal cortical dysplasia in the right frontal lobe. So, that's cool, I guess.

By Arizona state law, I cannot drive for 90 days after a seizure. Hopefully, remote work can save me. And after the 90 days are up, I guess I'm walking on a minefield, where one wrong step will explode in my face and prevent me from driving another three months. Thank you brain, very cool.
