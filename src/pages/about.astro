  <Blurb
    header={'Even More About Me'}
    text="In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, particularly progressive house and j-rock. I also enjoy playing games, including modding games like Skyrim. Some of my favorite content creators are Fireship and Northernlion, and I enjoy watching vtubers. In addition to these hobbies, I have two dogs that I enjoy spending time with. Overall, I am always looking for new and interesting ways to entertain myself and expand my interests."
