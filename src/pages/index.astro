    text="I am a full-stack web developer. I am drawn to the immediate visual impact of my work on a website and connecting the front-end experience with the power of the backend. I like to bring my ideas to life and create dynamic, user-friendly experiences. Seeing the changes I make reflected on a website is both satisfying and addictive, and I am excited to continue learning and growing."
