<h1 class="text-6xl font-bold m-4 mb-8">Hi, I'm Wesley</h1>
<p class="m-4 text-xl leading-8">
  I am a web developer and graduate from the
  <span class="font-bold text-purple-800">University of Washington</span>
  , where I received my bachelor's degree in Geography: Data Science. 
  I developed a passion for computers in high school when I took AP Computer Science
  and decided to pursue a career in programming.

  As a front-end or full-stack web developer, I am drawn to the immediate visual impact of
  my work on a website. I enjoy using framework libraries like React and Svelte to bring
  my ideas to life and create dynamic, user-friendly experiences. Seeing the changes I
  make reflected on a website is both satisfying and addictive, and I am excited to
  continue learning and growing in this field.
