    <p class="mb-4">July 2022 - September 2022</p>
    <p>
      My first ever internship, I helped the small information technology department for International
      Wood Products, the leading lumber and engineered wood products distributor in the Pacific Northwest.
      I learned a lot about hardware, Microsoft systems like Active Directory, and also spent a lot of time
      helping people around the company with technical issues and physical installations.

    <p class="mb-4">January 2023 - March 2023</p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Starting in January and continuing until March, I participated in my first few hackathons, 
      these being the community-run TreasureHacks, and Major League Hacking sanctioned Transport 
      and Whisker Hacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, a group project for TransportHacks, Package Tracker, took the award of best overall hack, 
      while my project Picatso won the awards for best domain name and best use of Auth0. In Treasure Hacks, 
      my group bit off a bit too much in learning a new language, Rust, and new framework, Tauri. These hackathons 
      have given be invaluable experience in cooperating with others efficiently under a time constraint.

    <p class="mb-4">May 2023</p>
    <p>
      Given a return offer to International Wood Products, I returned in May 2023. Working at this company is fun and gives me 
      unique opportunities. I've been called the data magic guy, for writing Python and Powershell scripts which save the team hours 
      of manual work and labor, one of which automates a report for the accounting department that saves around an hour each day.
      I've been giving the chance to take charge of starting and making an internal wiki for the company.
